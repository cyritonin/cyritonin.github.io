<p>The first program I ever wrote was when I was 10 years old and my uncle helped me make a number guessing game in Ruby
<br>Since then I've worked in <em>Python</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>C#</em> and right now <em>C++</em>.</p>

		<h2>Java</h2>
		<p>The language I'm most familiar with and the one I've worked with the most. This is my go-to language for
		everything not game development related.</p>

		<h2>C# and C++</h2>
		<p>I've used C# when creating mods for games and is the program I use when making my own. I'm also taking
		a class to learn C++ right now.</p>

		<h2>Python</h2>
		<p>The language that I've used the least and I only really learned the basics. However
		I'm confident that if I put the time in I can master it just as well as the other languages.</p>
